This system is an implementation of **Heroes Unbound** system by Aldo J. Regalado for Foundry Virtual Table Top.

## Contents
### Features
This system features:
- 1 **Actor** type - **Hero** - and its Sheet
- 4 **Item** types - **Maneuver**, **Power**, **Situation**, **Skill** - and their Sheets
- **Effect Roll**, which displays **Knockout** and **Core** results
  - Effect Roll can be performed either by a button on Hero Sheet, or by using `/effect X` command (where `X` is number of d6s) 

### Content
This System contains no actual content. A game manual of **Heroes Unbound** (or other related system) as well as certain level of manual input is required to play the game.

## Troubleshooting and Debug
If you want to have deeper understanding of why system behaves the way it does, **you can enable Debug in system's setting**.

This setting makes it so that the system will output a ton of information into the console whenever is performs or attempts to perform an action.

You can open the console by using `F12` keybind on most browsers.

**Tip**: Use `Heroes Unbound` as filter in console to only see this system's messages.


## Recommended 3rd Party Modules
By default Foundry only offers 2 Attribute Bars on Tokens and system sets them as Endurance and Knockout. While you can freely change that, you are still limited to only 2 bars.

If you want to be able to display 3 Attribute Bars (Knockout, Endurance and Body), or maybe even more, you can achieve this by using [Bar Brawl](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/barbrawl) module.

To improve the immersion of the game I also highly recommend the [Dice so Nice](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice/) module.
